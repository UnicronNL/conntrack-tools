conntrackd can run in two modes:
- statistics mode
- synchronization mode

This package comes with a sample configuration file for the statistics
mode in (/etc/conntrackd/conntrackd.conf).  There are also sample
configuration files for the synchronization mode in
/usr/share/doc/conntrackd/examples.
